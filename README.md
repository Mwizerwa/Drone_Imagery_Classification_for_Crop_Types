# Drone_Imagery_Classification_for_Crop_Types
In this project, I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and leveraged the ResNet 50 architecture to create a model for classifying images in a dataset provided by RTI International. This dataset consisted of 2,611 labeled point locations representing 19 distinct land cover types across various agroecological zones in Rwanda. These land cover categories were condensed into three crop types (Banana, Maize, and Legume), alongside two non-crop land cover types (Forest and Structure), and a comprehensive Other category. Each data point included latitude and longitude coordinates, land cover type, and a confidence score from the labeler
